## Explanation
LetsChat is a messaging app where users can create topics and chat about them.

## Problem
People love to talk about their shared interests but forums can be too slow and clunky, and message apps can be annoying with constant notifications.

## Solution
LetsChat combines the organization and persistence of a forum with the speed and spontaneity of a live chat.

## Results
The end result is a clean, simple conversation that users can hop into and out of at any time.

## Conclusion
LetsChat was fun to build and has potential features I’d like to explore, like voice chat, gif support and reactions.
